# Angular Cardflow

This is for making ng-repeat items that flow into a nice & efficient coverflow.  It is inspired by [angular-coverflow](https://github.com/southdesign/angular-coverflow), but differs in that it can handle images, divs, or whatever you like that is ng-repeating, and I am trying to use more angular libraries.

This is currently incomplete. I am still working out the basic idea.

See an [example](http://konsumer.github.io/angular-cardflow/)

## Usage

See files in `examples` for usage examples, but here's the basics:

1. Include the cardflow.js script provided by this component into your app.
2. Add angular-cardflow as a module dependency to your app.
3. Add CSS to make it look nice. There is an example in `examples/cardflow.css`
